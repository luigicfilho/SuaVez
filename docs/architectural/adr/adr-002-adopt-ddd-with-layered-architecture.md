# ADR: Adopt Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with Layered Architecture

## Status
[status]

## Context
We are developing a new [Project Name] application, a [description of the application].  [goal description][problem statement]

#### Conclusion
[goal][result of the context]

## Decision

We will use DDD as the guiding principle for our architecture.  Specifically, we will implement the following layers:

*   **Web Layer (Web App):** This layer handles user interactions, request routing, and presentation logic. It interacts with the Application Layer.  It is the outermost layer.
*   **Application Layer:** This layer orchestrates use cases and interacts with the Domain Layer. It does not contain business logic itself but delegates to the Domain.  It is technology agnostic.
*   **Domain Layer:** This layer contains the core business logic, domain models (entities, value objects), and domain services.  It is the heart of the application.  It is technology agnostic.
*   **Infrastructure Layer:** This layer provides concrete implementations for interfaces defined in the Domain and Application Layers. It handles persistence, messaging, external API integrations, and other technical concerns.  It is technology specific.

## Consequences

[description of possible consequences]

**Positive:**

*   Improved maintainability and testability.
*   Clear separation of concerns.
*   Better alignment with business requirements.
*   Increased flexibility in changing the presentation layer.
*   Easier to evolve the application as business needs change.

**Negative:**

*   Increased complexity (initially).
*   Learning curve for developers.
*   Potential for over-engineering for very simple applications.
